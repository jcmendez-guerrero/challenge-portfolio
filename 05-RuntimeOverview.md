The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios, for the case of this project we will just summarize the main scenarios that are part of the system.

## 5.1 Scenario 1 - PR

| Actor | Description |
|---|---|
| **DevOps Engineer** | Interacts with GitHub to review and merge PRs. |
| **DevOps Collaborator** | Codes, generates unit tests, and regression traces, and creates PRs. |


| Participant | Description |
|---|---|
| **IDE** | Used by the DevOps Collaborator for coding and generating tests. |
| **GitHub** | Central repository for code, handles PRs, and communicates with Jenkins. |
| **Jenkins** | CI/CD tool that handles various stages of the build and deployment process. |

     F -->|Tests Fail| E[Send Failure Message]
     G --> I[Final Steps]
     J[DevOps Engineer] -->|Review and Merge PR| I
```

1. **Code and PR Creation**: The Collaborator codes, generates unit tests, and regression traces in the IDE and creates a PR in GitHub. Optionally label the PR as Hot-fix
2. **Jenkins Build Process**: GitHub triggers a webhook to Jenkins, acknowledges the webhook and scans the project.
3. **Commit Linting**: Jenkins verifies the commit and runs `npm install` and `commitlint`.
    - If commit linting is valid, Jenkins sends a "Commit OK" message to GitHub.
    - If commit linting fails, Jenkins checks for errors and sends detailed messages to GitHub, failing the build if necessary.
4. **Labeling PRs**:
    - If there are conventional commits, Jenkins generates a label array and labels the PR in GitHub.
    - If there are revert commits, Jenkins labels the PR as a revert.
    - If neither, Jenkins sends a failure message and fails the build.
5. **Build and Test**:
    - Jenkins builds the project and checks test results (unit and regression).
    - If tests pass, Jenkins publishes the test results.
    - If tests fail, Jenkins publishes the test results, sends detailed messages to GitHub, and fails the build.
6. **Final Steps**:
    - The DevOps Engineer reviews and merges the PR in GitHub.

## 5.2 Scenario 2 - Standard Master Merge


| Actor              | Description                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **DevOps Engineer**| Interacts with Jenkins UI to authorize releases.         |


| Participant | Description |
|---|---|
| **Jenkins** | CI/CD tool that handles various stages of the build and deployment process. |
| **Jenkins UI** | Interface for Jenkins where the DevOps Engineer authorizes releases. |
| **GitHub** | Central repository for code, handles PRs, and communicates with Jenkins. |
| **Jira** | Project management tool used for pulling XRAY test results. |
| **MS Teams** | Communication tool used for notifications. |

    K -->J[Generate Release Branch]
    J --> L[Generate GitHub Release]
    L -->|Release Success| M[Notify MS Teams]
    L -->|Release Fail| F
```

1. **GitHub Webhook**: GitHub triggers a webhook to Jenkins, acknowledges the webhook and scans the project.
2. **Revert Check**: Jenkins checks if the head is a revert commit and sets the environment variable `IS_REVERT` accordingly to skip checks.
3. **Build and Test**: Jenkins builds the project and checks test results (unit and regression).
   - If tests pass, Jenkins publishes the test results.
   - If tests fail, Jenkins publishes the test results, sends detailed messages to GitHub, and fails the build.
4. **Functional Testing**:
   - Jenkins requests functional tests and waits for execution to finish.
   - Jenkins pulls XRAY test results from Jira and checks the results (Quality Gate 2).
5. **HotFix Release**:
   - Jenkins retrieves the last PR from GitHub and checks PR labels.
   - If the PR is a fix or hotfix, Jenkins retrieves the last release and generates the next tag.
   - Jenkins checks stable and prerelease tags and processes the release accordingly.
   - Jenkins sets the environment variable `IS_HOTFIX` and loads the release config.
   - Jenkins generates the fix CHANGE_LOG, clones the repo, checks out the release, and cherry-picks changes.
   - If the cherry-pick is successful, Jenkins commits and pushes the changes, generates the release, and notifies MS Teams.
   - If the cherry-pick fails, Jenkins notifies MS Teams of the failure.
6. **Release Authorization**: Jenkins requests release authorization from the DevOps Engineer via Jenkins UI.
   - The DevOps Engineer authorizes the release by providing a password and user.
   - If authorization is successful, Jenkins sets the environment variable `AUTH_RELEASE`.
7. **Generate Release Branch**:
    - Jenkins retrieves the last release from GitHub and checks for differences.
    - If differences exist, Jenkins checks the tag, retrieves the last release, and generates the next tag.
    - Jenkins generates the CHANGE_LOG, checks out a new branch, commits, and pushes the changes.
    - Jenkins sets the environment variable `DO_DEPLOY`.
8. **Generate GitHub Release**:
    - If `AUTH_RELEASE` and `DO_DEPLOY` are defined and the status is SUCCESS, Jenkins retrieves tags from GitHub.
    - Jenkins checks stable and prerelease tags and generates release notes.
    - Jenkins generates the release and notifies MS Teams if successful.
    - If the release fails, Jenkins fails the build.

## 5.3 Scenario 3 - Stable Release Generation

| Actor              | Description                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **DevOps Engineer**| Interacts with Jenkins UI to manually trigger and authorize releases. |

| Participant        | Description                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Jenkins**        | CI/CD tool that handles various stages of the build and deployment process. |
| **Jenkins UI**     | Interface for Jenkins where the DevOps Engineer authorizes releases. |
| **Jenkins Timer**  | Triggers the release process on a schedule.              |
| **GitHub**         | Central repository for code, handles PRs, and communicates with Jenkins. |
| **Jira**           | Project management tool used for pulling XRAY test results. |
| **MS Teams**       | Communication tool used for notifications.               |

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Trigger Release] -->|Timer Trigger| C
    A -->|Manual Trigger| B[Functional Testing]
    H -->|Wait for Auth| H
    G[DevOps Engineer] -->|Authorize| H

    H -->|Manual Request| D[Generate Release Branch]
    C -->|Timer Trigger| D
    D --> E[Generate GitHub Release]
    E --> F[Post-Release Actions]
```

1. **Trigger Release**:
   - **Timer Trigger**: Jenkins Timer triggers the release process on the 1st or 15th of the month.
   - **Manual Trigger**: The DevOps Engineer manually requests a stable release generation.
2. **Functional Testing**:
   - Jenkins pulls XRAY test results from Jira and checks the results (Quality Gate 2).
3. **Authorize Release**:
   - **Manual Request**: Jenkins requests release authorization from the DevOps Engineer via Jenkins UI.
     - The DevOps Engineer authorizes the release by providing a password and user.
     - If authorization is successful, Jenkins sets the environment variable `AUTH_RELEASE`.
     - If authorization times out or fails, Jenkins fails the build.
   - **Timer Trigger**: Jenkins sets the environment variable `AUTH_RELEASE` automatically once checking the timer.
4. **Generate Release Branch**:
   - Jenkins retrieves the last release from GitHub and checks for differences.
   - If differences exist, Jenkins checks the tag, retrieves the last release, and generates the next tag.
   - Jenkins generates the CHANGE_LOG, checks out a new branch, commits, and pushes the changes.
   - Jenkins sets the environment variable `DO_DEPLOY`.
5. **Generate GitHub Release**:
   - If `AUTH_RELEASE` and `DO_DEPLOY` are defined and the status is SUCCESS, Jenkins retrieves tags from GitHub.
   - Jenkins checks stable and prerelease tags and generates release notes.
   - Jenkins retrieves stable and prerelease releases from GitHub.
   - If the prerelease commitish does not exist, Jenkins fails the build.
   - Jenkins clones the JSL repo, checks out the stable branch, and resets from the prerelease commitish.
   - Jenkins force pushes the changes and updates the stable release on GitHub.
   - Jenkins publishes the release to MS Teams.
   - Jenkins updates the prerelease release with the new commitish and tag.
6. **Post-Release Actions**:
   - If the release process fails, Jenkins publishes the failure to MS Teams.
